"Technical Help Request to Start (No Instances, Yet)","Hi there, I'm using GCP instances for quite a while and I need some mobile android environment, so I want to ask if it's possible to find an affordable solution to my request here on AWS.

I need 5-10 mobile instances, on-demand usage, with static IP addresses that are specific to each one, what I actually need is dedicated IPs. I need to connect to the devices both via SSH and RDP-like applications, NoMachine or AnyDesk probably.

I'm not sure if it's as easy as GCP to turn ON/OFF instances via a mobile app or connecting to them in seconds. I'm into using AWS for my projects, but not sure how to get into it.

A walkthrough to create an android environment in device farm with a static IP would be great point to start. I also need to calculate the estimated costs for that kind of usage per device+IP. Thanks for any help!

Regards, Akif.

PS: Uptime would be a total of 2-3 hours for all the devices per day, I mean like 15 min per device per day for now. I hope to implement a bigger part of my work into mobile, so that I could increase this usage.",Akif,$50 - $100,None,"November 9, 2022 at 7:27 PM"

Failed to call Connect services using HTTP calls with AWS Sig 4,"Hey I am trying to call services like AssociateInstanceStorageConfig and CreateContactFlow through raw HTTP call with AWS Sig 4. I got the error message: ""User: arn:aws:iam::510845801333:user/Administrator is not authorized to perform: connect:* on resource: * with an explicit deny""
I am sure that the User(Administator) has full Amazon Connect access, and it has no problem calling DynamoDB service to create a table
Don't ask me to use SDK, because for some reason we need to use HTTP with AWS Sig 4.
Please provide viable solution for my problem

Launching a new DeFi exchange,"Hi,

Looking to get some advise and guidance on the best solution for a DeFi exchange with pools and farming and potentially an NFT marketplace, looking for a soluiton to be developed which is scaleable and able to handle user demand 24/7 globally.

Would be great to work with a company or indervidual long term, who we can work in collaboration with as the dex developes and grows.
